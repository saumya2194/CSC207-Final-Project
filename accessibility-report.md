# Principle 1: Equitable Use
by letting all users, whether students or researchers,
log in the same way and access the same experiments.
Everyone can view all experiments without any restrictions,
ensuring fairness and equal access.

# Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Flexibility in Use does not fully apply to this code because the
functionality—like logging in and viewing experiments—is
straightforward and does not require multiple methods of
interaction or physical adaptability.
The system's primary focus is on equitable access to information,
rather than accommodating diverse interaction styles or physical abilities,
which are unnecessary in this context.

# Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
- The software is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive manner
- Buttons such as "create experiment" and "profile" are clear and direct in communicating purpose
- To view an experiment, the user may scroll through the table to find it, and simply double click on the row to open it
- Related elements are kept close together( my experiments table and create experiment button for instance)

# Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
- The software is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive manner
- Buttons such as "create experiment" and "profile" are clear and direct in communicating purpose
- To view an experiment, the user may scroll through the table to find it, and simply double click on the row to open it

# Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Features are designed to be easy to access and use,
reducing the chance of errors. When errors do occur,
clear and helpful error messages guide users on how to fix the issue.
The program also includes checks and safeguards that prevent users from
accidentally causing significant problems. By handling errors gracefully
and making recovery simple, the system stays reliable and user-friendly,
even if users make unintended actions. This approach helps create a safe
and stress-free experience for all users.
# Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

- This app largely involves typing, scrolling and clicking buttons.
- None of these tasks require significant operating force or physical effort
- Effort required to physically navigate the app is kept to a minimum

# Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.
- This is not really relevant to our program, as it does not exist tangibly to be modified to adapt to differences in space


For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle.
If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers.
This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games".
Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Such a program would be marketed to 2 different categories of users.
Firstly, there would be the research institutions who need participants for experiments.
At least to start, our ideal client would be the University of Toronto.
We would work with the administration and researchers to create a centralized platform for all paid research experiment participation.
The second would be those wishing to make a bit of extra money by participating in paid experiments.
At least initially, our primary target for this group would be University of Toronto students.

# Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics.
# Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our program in the form that it currently is in, is less likely to be used by older adults not working in research.
This is because younger adults tend to have less money, and make less per hour in their jobs, and students may not be making any money at all.
As such, they are more monetarily incentivised to participate in such experiments, while older adults are not.
From an accessibility standpoint, we do not have accomodations built onto our app for the disabled and visually impared, so they may be less likely to use it.
