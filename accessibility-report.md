# Principle 1: Equitable Use
The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

This program is pretty simplistic and has a design that is not based on the preferences of any sector of users.
The program could be improved for those with disabilities by providing text to audio reading options, and other features to assist the visually impaared.



Principle 1 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 1:

1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.
1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.
1d. Make the design appealing to all users.
# Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

- This app is quite simple to use and accomodates both right handed and left handed use. 
- We could improve this 

Principle 2 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 2:

2a. Provide choice in methods of use.
2b. Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.
2c. Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
2d. Provide adaptability to the user's pace.
# Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
- The software is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive manner
- Buttons such as "create experiment" and "profile" are clear and direct in communicating purpose
- To view an experiment, the user may scroll through the table to find it, and simply double click on the row to open it
- Related elements are kept close together( my experiments table and create experiment button for instance)
Principle 3 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 3:

3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance.
3e. Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.
# Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
- The software is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive manner
- Buttons such as "create experiment" and "profile" are clear and direct in communicating purpose
- To view an experiment, the user may scroll through the table to find it, and simply double click on the row to open it


Principle 4 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 4:

4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
4b. Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
4c. Maximize "legibility" of essential information.
4d. Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).
4e. Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.
# Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
- We have certain features in place to ensure slight errors do not cause major program problems
- We could improve this via more complex features including :
  - an email verification to ensure email entered is correct
  - disabling the adding of experiments with the same name

Principle 5 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 5:



5a. Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
5b. Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
5c. Provide fail safe features.
5d. Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.
# Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

- This app largely involves typing, scrolling and clicking buttons. 
- None of these tasks require significant operating force or physical effort
- Effort required to physically navigate the app is kept to a minimum


Principle 6 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 6:

6a. Allow user to maintain a neutral body position.
6b. Use reasonable operating forces.
6c. Minimize repetitive actions.
6d. Minimize sustained physical effort.
# Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.
- This is not really relevant to our program, as it does not exist tangibly to be modified to adapt to differences in space


Principle 7 Guidelines
The following guidelines underpin Principle 7:

7a. Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.
7b. Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
7c. Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.
7d. Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.



For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. 
If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. 
This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". 
Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Such a program would be marketed to 2 different categories of users. 
Firstly, there would be the research institutions who need participants for experiments. 
At least to start, our ideal client would be the University of Toronto.
We would work with the administration and researchers to create a centralized platform for all paid research experiment participation.
The second would be those wishing to make a bit of extra money by participating in paid experiments.
At least initially, our primary target for this group would be University of Toronto students.

# Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 
# Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our program in the form that it currently is in, is less likely to be used by older adults not working in research.
This is because younger adults tend to have less money, and make less per hour in their jobs, and students may not be making any money at all.
As such, they are more monetarily incentivised to participate in such experiments, while older adults are not.
From an accessibility standpoint, we do not have accomodations built onto our app for the disabled and visually impared, so they may be less likely to use it.
