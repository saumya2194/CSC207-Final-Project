## **Project Summary**
**ExperimentHub** is a platform designed to connect researchers and experimenters with individuals who are willing to participate in experiments. Whether you are conducting a medical study, a psychology experiment, or any other type of research, ExperimentHub provides an easy-to-use interface to post your experiment and find willing volunteers.

On the flip side, volunteers can browse experiments and sign up to participate. This project was developed to facilitate the recruitment process for researchers and streamline the volunteer process for potential participants.
