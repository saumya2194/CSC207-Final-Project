## **Project Summary**
**ExperimentHub** is a platform that connects researchers with people who want 
to participate in experiments. Whether it’s a medical study, 
a psychology experiment, or any other type of research, 
ExperimentHub makes it simple for researchers to post their studies and find volunteers. 
At the same time, volunteers can easily browse through experiments 
and sign up for ones that interest them. 
The goal of ExperimentHub is to make it easier for researchers to recruit 
participants and for volunteers to get involved in meaningful research. 
It’s all about bringing people together to make research happen.
